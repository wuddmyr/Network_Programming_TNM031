The specific looping scenario just described can be avoided using a technique known
as poisoned reverse. The idea is simple—if z routes through y to get to destination x,
then z will advertise to y that its distance to x is infinity, that is, z will advertise to y
that D z (x) = ∞ (even though z knows D z (x) = 5 in truth). z will continue telling this
little white lie to y as long as it routes to x via y. Since y believes that z has no path
to x, y will never attempt to route to x via z, as long as z continues to route to x via y
(and lies about doing so).
